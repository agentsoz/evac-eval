# Maximum-flow method run on fire ffdi100a

## Each population raster-cell with non-zero population and inside the fire is assigned a "population node" (injection-node) - the network node having largest maximum out-capacity

### Links coloured by capacity and population nodes coloured by largest maximum out-capacity:
